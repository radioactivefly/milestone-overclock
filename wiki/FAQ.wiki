===Can I run this on the Droid even though it's called milestone-overclock?===

Yes! It started out on the Milestone because of its locked down nature, but since versio 1.3 has been made to work on the Droid, at least with stock firmware. If you run into problems with it please open an issue. If I make this compatible with more phones, maybe I'll have to rename it ;)

===Why doesn't the overclock last between reboots?===

When you overclock with this app, you're merely changing values in RAM. It's not like the usual approach to overclock that involves flashing something. So you'll have to overclock again each time it boots up. To automate this process you must load the module in boot time with either [http://www.androlib.com/android.application.nk-bla-android-autostart-qmnB.aspx Autostart] or with mot_boot_mode. Please note that this is quite dangerous because if you set up the wrong values you may end up with a phone that crashes before it boots completely. I recommend Autostart because you can bypass it easily by booting in [https://supportforums.motorola.com/message/99124#99124 safe mode] which is easy to do. Otherwise you'll have to flash the phone.

===I'm trying to load the module in a script but the phone crashes as soon as I set any parameter!===

The module by default uses memory addresses for Milestone EU/Telus firmware. You'll have to pass it the address of a special function so that it can autodetect other firmwares. It's quite simple, see [KernelModule#Autodetect here] how to do it. Of course, loading from the App takes care of this problem.

===Isn't this pointless due to SetCPU?===

The two are complementary, and I actually recommend to use SetCPU. First of all you need a kernel with the overclocked frequencies: you either flash one, or use this project and change them in realtime. Only then SetCPU comes in to actually set the frequency you want based on those available.

===How can I set 1300 MHz?===

1300 MHz is _very_ unstable, I rarely could set it and have since given up. Go to
settings and set the custom frequency 1300000 and custom vsel 127 (or less if you
manage it) -- this is also a known dangerous vsel (out of processor specs). IT WILL MOST LIKELY REBOOT/CRASH. You may need to remove the battery in the worst case (happened to me sometimes). All in all I don't recommend anyone trying it.
