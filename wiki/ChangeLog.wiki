#summary ChangeLog of project milestone-overclock
#labels Featured

== Version 1.4.1 - 2010-08-30 ==

=== App ===

  * Fix support for XT701
  * Fix cpufreq_stats_table_addr when saving settings and loading the module

=== Kernel Module ===

  * Change cpufreq stats when writing to /proc/overclock/freq_table

== Version 1.4 - 2010-08-27 ==

=== App ===

  * Autoload overclock on boot. This requires a mounted external storage. If the phone freezes during boot, simply delete the file /sdcard/Android/data/pt.com.darksun.milestoneoverclock/files/autoload (or remove the sdcard) to disable autoload.
  * Support for Droid X (2.1), A854 and XT720
  * Improved root detection (tries to do a "su echo test" to check for a working su)

=== Kernel module ===

  * Support kernel 2.6.32 (AOSP's Froyo), although I can't get it to load on Droid no matter what vermagic I use
  * Improve the build process to compile against multiple kernels
  * Stop using default addresses for mpu_opps_addr and cpufreq_stats_table_addr to avoid confusion
  * Get the address of freq_table automatically with cpufreq_frequency_get_table()
  * Fix assignments when writing to /proc/overclock/omap2_clk_init_cpufreq_table_addr (thanks kabaldan)
  * Fix cpufreq stats (patch by kabaldan)

== Version 1.3.2 - 2010-05-31 ==

=== App ===

  * Restore support for Milestone A853

== Version 1.3 - 2010-05-30 ==

=== App ===

  * *Works with the Droid*, at least with stock kernels

== Version 1.2 - 2010-05-25 ==

=== App ===

  * *Should work with any Milestone with stock Android 2.x*
  * Searches /proc/kallsyms for the address of omap2_clk_init_cpufreq_table and passes it to the kernel module when it is loaded

=== Kernel module ===

  * Change the values of freq_table by writing "index frequency" to /proc/overclock/freq_table such as: echo "1 400000" > /proc/overclock/freq_table
  * Change the values of mpu_opps by writing "index rate vsel" to /proc/overclock/mpu_opps such as: echo "3 400000000 50" > /proc/overclock/mpu_opps
  * Autodetect freq_table and mpu_opps given omap2_clk_init_cpufreq_table's address at load time (load with omap2_clk_init_cpufreq_table=0xc004e498) or in runtime with: echo 0xc004e498 > /proc/overclock/omap2_clk_init_cpufreq_table_addr (you can find the address with: grep omap2_clk_init_cpufreq_table /proc/kallsyms)

== Version 1.1 - 2010-05-23 ==

=== App ===

  * Created settings menu with custom rate and custom vsel (available in the seekbar), and manual freq_table and mpu_opps addresses (used when the module is loaded)
  * Corrected vsel units

=== Kernel module ===

  * mpu_opps now configurable in load time
  * Improved mpu_opps address lookup
  * Corrected vsel units
  * Applied mattih's patch to set policy->user_policy.max

== Version 1.0 - 2010-05-17 ==

  * Initial release
